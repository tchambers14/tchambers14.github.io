When I received a whatsapp detailing that the 2020-21 season will not go ahead I was bitterly disappointed, Old Alleynian's had been on a good run in the previous season, and training sessions through September and October had reminded everyone at the club the value that rugby brings.

This disappointment however is trivial in the context to the hardships that many people in our community and around the world are experiencing. In the context of the COVID-19 in the UK, cancelling a rugby season is most certainly a sensible thing to do to protect people from getting seriously ill and to help everyone get back to normality as soon as possible. The number of people facing genuine hardship through this period puts rugby in perspective and rather than dwell on a season that won't be the question I believe we should be asking is:

>_How can we make this time as constructive as possible?_

For me this boils down to two things:

1. Supporting Players
2. Preparing the Club

## Supporting Players

The impact of the virus is felt in many ways, affecting loved ones and livelihoods. At its core a _community_ rugby club is just that a _community_ and as far as possible we should strive to ensure that all players, (and club members) feel supported by the club through whatever difficulties they are facing. 

> How can we support our players?

- Creating ways for players to engage with the club through lock-down
- Encouraging players to stay active
- Encouraging players to share ideas about how to move the club forward

Through encouraging an ongoing dialogue with players we can continue to identify ways to help evolve the club to meet their needs. This period creates an opportunity to really listen to players and to involve them in the evolution of the club through actively encouraging them to bring their ideas to life.

## Preparing the Club

The loss of a season creates a huge amount of time. Time to think, time to create and time to re-evaluate. Ordinarily in a busy season this is not a luxury that a coaching team has. This period creates an unprecedented opportunity to think strategically about the development of the club and to improve the experience of players volunteers and supporters for years to come.

> What ways can we support the development of the club?

- Creating stronger connections with other areas of the club (Ladies, Mens, Juniors, Vets, Committees etc...)
- Creating more efficient processes to enable volunteers to be more impactful
- Identifying and launching strategic projects for the club, to improve facilities or expand offerings
- Identifying opportunities to partner with local organisations (Schools, Other Clubs, Physio Clinics, Gyms etc...)

Kicking off some new initiatives can be a great way to help foster a community ethos at a time when contact is limited. By re-framing the loss of a season as an opportunity to lay some ground work to improve the future I hope to reflect on this time as being well spent for the betterment of tomorrow.
