Having just completed the shore based course for Day Skipper with [Nomad Sailing](https://www.nomadsailing.co.uk/) I cannot recommend them highly enough. A well paced and structured 8 week classroom based course, culminating in two exams, was led by Jim Barden who was both extremely patient and incredibly knowledgeable.

The course covered the basics of nautical chart work, navigation, weather systems and saftey at sea.
