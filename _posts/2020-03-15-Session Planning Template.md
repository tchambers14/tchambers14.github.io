This is the base template that I use to plan training sessions at OAs, please let me know what you think of it via [email](mailto:chambersrugby@gmail.com).

Using this as a base template prompts me to use the principles of play in delivering training sessions, helps align messaging from all of the coaches to the players, and provides a prompt during the session to ensure that the session runs smoothly.
