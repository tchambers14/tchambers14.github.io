## How often are you nearly complete on a software delivery?


> _"But this problem is different"_

> _"The next release will solve our problem"_

> _"Once we complete 'blah' we will be back on track"_

It strikes me how many times I catch myself devising new ways to approach problems, illustrating just how tempting to think that a specific problem is somehow special. In reality this is rarely the case.

Yes it is true that in large complex systems emergent properties are hard to analyse upfront, however frameworks and approaches are out there that provide approaches to minimise the impact of unforeseen issues.

Further evidence of this:
See books on software engineering from the 1960s and see the multimillion dollar consulting empires that assist companies in delivering software projects.

According to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/digital-transformation-market)
_"The global digital transformation market size was valued at USD 284.38 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.5% from 2020 to 2027")_
This market would not exist if there was a clearly successful 'best way' to solve software engineering challenges.

## Optimism

> _"Computer programming, however, creates with an exceedingly tractable medium. The programmer builds from pure thought-stuff: concepts and very flexible representations thereof. Because the medium is tractable, we expect few difficulties in implementation; hence our pervasive optimism. Because our ideas are faulty, we have bugs; hence our optimism is unjustified."_

This first struck me when I read [The Mythical Man Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) by Fred Brooks[^1]. This book was written in **1975**! 45 years on the challenges described in this book are still very much relevant to modern software development practice.

Many of themes described in the book are as relevant today as they were in 1975 echos can be found in Mik Kersten's, excellent, [Project to Product](https://projecttoproduct.org/)[^2] thinking and the [SAFe - Scaled Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)

Indeed it is straight forward to find multiple scholarly articles such as [this one](https://www.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/Jorgensen.2005.2.pdf) by JÃ¸rgense and Grimstad documenting the phenomena.

Emergent properties, time for design and test, integration of challenges arising from political phenomena (if your interested in this read about [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)... )

## Humility

Ok, so software engineering challenges are hard, there are pitfalls that people have been falling into for 45+ years. what do we do about it?

The key take away from this is to constantly question your approach, and seek help. Be it best pr

I find myself starting from scratch time and time again.  My new mantra has become, someone has done this before.

2 mins of searching on the web yields a template, a guide, some advice an example. I am not supposing that these are always useful, but seeking some external views on how to approach the problem can

- a) help to validate your own thinking,
- b) help to sell your approach to others. "I'm using best practice from this multimillion dollar guru" can be quite a compelling argument
