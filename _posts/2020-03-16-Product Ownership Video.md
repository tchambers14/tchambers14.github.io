This is one of the best videos I have come across on product ownership.

{% include video id="502ILHjX9EE" provider="youtube" %}

My favourite part is the way it provides a simple framework for how the roles in an agile team support each other through the creation of healthy tension. _(9m 37s in the video)_

- Product Owner - "BUILD THE RIGHT THING"
- Dev Team - "BUILD THE THING RIGHT"

This for me really sums up the critical function of product ownership: as being an agent for the client and a member of the technical team.

Product ownership is about creating a clear path for the technical team to follow, whilst ensuring that the clients are getting value for money.
