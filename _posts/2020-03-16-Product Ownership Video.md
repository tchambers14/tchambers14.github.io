This is one of the best videos I have come across on the topic of product ownership.

{% include video id="502ILHjX9EE" provider="youtube" %}

My favourite part is the way it provides a simple framework for how the roles in an agile team support each other in delivering value to clients, through creating a healthy tension. _(9m 37s in the video)_

- Product Owner - "BUILD THE RIGHT THING"
- Dev Team - "BUILD THE THING RIGHT"

This for me really crystallises the role of the PO as both an agent for the client and a component of the technical team. Product ownership is about managing trade offs to maximise long term client value.
