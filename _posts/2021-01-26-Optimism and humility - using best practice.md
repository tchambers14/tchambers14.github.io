## How often are software deliveries _actually_ unique?

A quick scan of the literature published on software development practice over the last 45 years will yield descriptions of challenges that resonate with most technologists today. According to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/digital-transformation-market)

> _"The global digital transformation market size was valued at USD 284.38 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.5% from 2020 to 2027”_

This existence of this market raises a paradox; on the one hand it must be possible to 'codify' software engineering practice such that consultancies can make a compelling case to sell it as a service. On the other hand, the fact that large organisations that have been developing software for decades have not identified a ‘best-way’ to operate suggests an evolving challenge.

How do we handle this paradox? It strikes me, in my work as a product owner, that it is tempting to feel that it is impossible to codify an approach to solve a specific problem, and to believe that there are specifics of any challenge that are unique. This allows the mental justification for devising a bespoke approach to solve that challenge and ignore any best practice guidance.

In my experience, tools and techniques can be rejected as the “won’t work for this specific problem”.
The trap is the temptation to continually devise novel approaches to each problem, rejecting tools and techniques as _“not suitable in this specific case”._

## Optimism

> _"The next release will solve our problem"_

> _"We just need to test ______"_

> _"But this problem is different"_

> _"Computer programming, however, creates with an exceedingly tractable medium. The programmer builds from pure thought-stuff: concepts and very flexible representations thereof. Because the medium is tractable, we expect few difficulties in implementation, hence our pervasive optimism. Because our ideas are faulty, we have bugs; hence our optimism is unjustified."_

This first struck me when I read [The Mythical Man Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) by Fred Brooks[^1]. This book was written in **1975**! 45 years on the challenges described in this book are still very much relevant to modern software development practice.

Many of themes described in the book are as relevant today as they were in 1975 echos can be found in Mik Kersten's, excellent, [Project to Product](https://projecttoproduct.org/)[^2] thinking and the [SAFe - Scaled Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)

Indeed it is straight forward to find multiple scholarly articles such as [this one](https://www.simula.no/sites/default/files/publications/Jorgensen.2005.2.pdf) by Jørgense and Grimstad documenting the phenomena.

Emergent properties, time for design and test, integration of challenges arising from political phenomena (if your interested in this read about [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)... )

## Humility

Ok, so software engineering challenges are hard, there are pitfalls that people have been falling into for 45+ years. what do we do about it?

Yes it is true that in large complex systems emergent properties are hard (or prohibitively expensive) to analyse upfront, however frameworks and approaches are out there that provide approaches to minimise the impact of unforeseen issues.

I argue that some problems are tractable and clear. And whilst all software deliveries are unique (by virtue of the people involved if nothing else), there is enough commonality between them that we can seek to use tools to help preserve brain power for the truly challenging and novel aspects of the problem. Just as a developer uses a third-party library – product owners should use templates, techniques and best practice to build the foundations of their daily working practices.

The key take-away from this is to constantly question your approach and seek help. Be it best pr

I find myself starting from scratch time and time again.  My new mantra has become, someone has done this before.

2 mins of searching on the web yields a template, a guide, some advice an example. I am not supposing that these are always useful, but seeking some external views on how to approach the problem can

- a) help to validate your own thinking,
- b) help to sell your approach to others. "I'm using best practice from this multimillion-dollar guru" can be quite a compelling argument.

in such a way that organisations experience improved performance, such that consultancy firms can successfully sell transformation programs. On the other hand, the fact that in 2020 organisations that have been developing software for decades have still not identified the 'best way' to organise themselves to deliver software suggests that any such codification effort could be futile.
As a result it is tempting to then devise new ways to break down the challenges and devise a way forward to complete the work. This believe justifies In reality this is rarely the case.
