My coaching philosophy is summed up by _"success through enjoyment"_. 

Having enjoyed playing rugby throughout my youth and early adult life I took up coaching in 2015 following an injury which ended my playing career. Since then I have been fortunate enough to hold [several coaching and leadership positions](/volunteering_cv/) at [Old Alleynians RFC](https://oarfc.rfu.club/){:target="_blank"} and am a qualified RFU Level 3 Coach.

The blog posts in this section are reflections from my coaching experience.
