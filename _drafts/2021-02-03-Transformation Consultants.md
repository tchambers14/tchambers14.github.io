### How often are software deliveries _actually_ unique?

A quick scan of the literature published on software development practice over the last 45 years will yield descriptions of challenges that resonate with most technologists today. According to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/digital-transformation-market)

> _"The global digital transformation market size was valued at USD 284.38 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.5% from 2020 to 2027”_

This existence of this market raises a paradox; on the one hand it must be possible to 'codify' software engineering practice such that consultancies can make a compelling case to sell it as a service. On the other hand, the fact that large organisations that have been developing software for decades have not identified a ‘best-way’ to operate suggests an evolving challenge. 

How do we handle this paradox? It strikes me, in my work as a product owner, that it is tempting to feel that it is impossible to codify an approach to solve a specific problem, and to believe that there are specifics of any challenge that are unique. This allows the mental justification for devising a bespoke approach to solve that challenge and ignore any best practice guidance.

In my experience, tools and techniques can be rejected as the “won’t work for this specific problem”.
The trap is the temptation to continually devise novel approaches to each problem, rejecting tools and techniques as _“not suitable in this specific case”._

Emergent properties of complex systems, adequate time for design and test iterations, challenges arising from political phenomena (if your interested in this read about [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)... )
