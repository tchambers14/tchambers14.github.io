Several years ago I began learning python development using [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) which has provided me with a powerful tool kit which has replaced excel and VBA as my 'go-to' in my professional role as a business analyst / product owner when analysing data and automating testing.

At the start of the COVID-19 lockdown I decided to explore front-end development technologies. Starting with ruby [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [github's pages](https://pages.github.com/). It quickly dawned on me how central javascript is in many front end apps, and how rich the JavaScript eco system is. I have since explored [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in building some small applications on my local machine.

My approach to learning has been as follows:

1. Develop an understanding of the syntax and basics
    - For this I have used the excellent [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
2. **SOLVE A PROBLEM**
    - For this I have challenged myself t create a fitness timer app using Vue.js framework and to deploy it using a cloud app provisioning service

Whilst it can be appealing to spend lots of time reading as much about a language as possible, nothing quite accelerates learning like a real problem to solve. I expect to post once my application is deployed....
