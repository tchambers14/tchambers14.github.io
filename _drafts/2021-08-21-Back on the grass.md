It has been great over the past month getting back on the grass at the rugby club and preparing a squad for a demanding league season ahead. 

So many of the aspects of the game that are not covered in touch games start to take on significance. Catch and drive, lineout, transition, kick return. 

It will be interesting times

Rugby for me is all about enjoyment, seeing things click on the pitch, players supporting and caoching each other to improve and a sennse that momentum is building is a great feeling.
