Interesting ideas:

- Consideration of the e2e value stream and bottle necks
- Measurement as a risk
Conecting technology and business - the cost centre problem

Many of themes described in the book are as relevant today as they were in 1975 echos can be found in Mik Kersten's, excellent, [Project to Product](https://projecttoproduct.org/)[^2] thinking and the [SAFe - Scaled Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)
