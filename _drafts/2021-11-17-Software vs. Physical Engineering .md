What i didn't like about this book. 

Software engineering is harder to be rigorous about, it is harder to depict, and less time and resources are provided (validate). 

Phyisical engineers are forced to be disciplined

Interesting ideas:

- Consideration of the e2e value stream and bottle necks
- Measurement as a risk

Connecting technology and business - the cost centre problem

Many of themes described in the book are as relevant today as they were in 1975 echos can be found in Mik Kersten's, excellent, [Project to Product](https://projecttoproduct.org/)[^2] thinking and the [SAFe - Scaled Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)

Entering a new era

Tracking value

Measuring the right things

The BMW analogy doesn't work, to showcase the best of manufacturing and to sayamufacturing is dead


This sort of clumsy analogy seems endemic amount the pop psychology of transformation consultations


The proposed value streams are so abstract and subjective as to be useless, and are supported by anecdote.

The concept of business value is abstract, and a mapping must be done between activities and revenues that is necessarily subjective. I am not arguing that attpting such an exercise is not valuable. But whether the organisation generates more value by a task taking 3 clicks or 4 is difficult to debate objectively.


One interesting idea is that many of the constructs assume the software product will be released to a market. In many organisations that market is effectively an oligopolistic one, where the client (an internal customer) buys off you or buys a cots product. 

It is interesting to note that the big tech fangs also market their internal products to external customers. This is an interesting approach but perhaps a risky one if these products form part of your competitive advantage.

Software has a challenge of people over machines
