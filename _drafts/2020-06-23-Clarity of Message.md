When observing any rugby activity a coach's eye is drawn to multiple things that are happening, both positive and negative. Positive contributions, bad habits, constructive behaviours, poor decision making, exceptional skill execution, any of which could warrant an intervention to reinforce good behaviours or correct poor ones.

The temptation is to feel that it is important to address everything at once. **This is a trap.**

### Deliberate vs. Emergent coaching
There needs to be enough deliberate coaching to ensure that players get a common thread and understand the core message, but flexibility to adapt a session if something constructive or exciting that wasn't planned has presented itself. In order to do this successfully a coach needs to understand very well their core values, and vision for the game. In addition the coaching group needs to share those values and that vision. If this is achieved training sessions can be diverse and exciting.

This challenge is made harder when coaching in a group, in any set of coaches each will have their own view of the aspects of the game they would like to develop with the players.

These two factors can lead to a real risk that players are bombarded with information. At half time, "and another thing"

This is bad for two reasons:
1. The players simply cannot take onboard all of the information and act on it
2. Each player will interpret the part of the message they feel the most affinity with
3. Each additional point dilutes your messaging as a coaching group

How can we combat this as coaches?

Firstly, being aware that the temptation is always there.
Secondly, planning messaging carefully


Tempting as a coach to bombard players with information. As coaches it is important to be judicious in your use of language, and have a clear set of values from which coaching interventions are derived.
Ask yourself _"what is the player going to do with that information??"_


Add note on consistent messaging
