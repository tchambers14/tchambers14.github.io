It strikes me how many times i catch myself devising new ways to approach problems. 

It is tempting to think that each new problem is special and different but that is rarely the case. 

See books on software engineering from the 1960s and see the multimillion dollar consulting empires that assist companies in delivering software projects. 

I find myself starting from scratch time and time again. My new mantra has become, someone has done this before. 

2 mins of searching on the web yields a template, a guide, some advice an example. I am not supposing that these are always useful, but seeking some external views on how to approach the problem can a) help to validate your own thinking, b) help to sell your approach to others. "I'm using best practice from this multimillion dollar guru" can be quite a compelling argument
