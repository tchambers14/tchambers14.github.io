Having been asked to work from home again in the two weeks leading to Christmas in the UK. The value of the office becomes patently clear....

Working from home has its charms. When working on tasks requiring a high level of concentration having a quiet and comfortable environment to work in is always helpful.

For me the challenge comes in the creation of new ideas.

 and in many regards can be highly efficient there are some things that are lost.

- High five moments
- Generating buy in for new ideas

- Opportunity to catch issues organically
- No need for formal processes, which are desperately needed when distributed. 
- New joiners, young people

Challenges of remote workings:

- Harder to create urgency
- Difficult to coach and motivate junior employees
- Fewer moments to release tension

and this is the kicker at Christmas time.

Lots of stuff in the papers about this at the moment too.

It is already happening that organisations are developing a multi-tiered workforce. I can foresee remote working contracts in the future.
