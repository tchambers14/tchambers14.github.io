Having been asked to work from home again in the UK. The value of the office becomes patently clear to me....


High five moments
Opportunity to catch issues organically
No need for formal processes, which are desperately needed when distributed. 
New joiners, young people

Challenges of remote workings:
Harder to create urgency
Fewer moments to release tension
