The current context of COVID-19 has severely disrupted rugby across the world. As we work through how to manage a few things have struck:

- Finding a way
- Different people use the club in different ways

> "Can we train anyway"

## A rugby club is not just about rugby

- Friendships
- Building confidence
- Staying healthy
- Meeting people

In the community game I also propose that the rugby club is a sanctuary

Has the power to be a sanctuary away from the world of work where people can be who they want to be and improve themsleves.
