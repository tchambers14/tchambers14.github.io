As a rugby coach there are a myriad of things to consider, for many it is a full-time job. With limited contact time with players and without the luxury of full-time staff, the amateur coach must be strategic about their use of time to maximise outcomes. In this post I will discuss how being on top of your admin can free up time, create clarity for players and bring ideas to life.

## Freeing up time

In the typical week a coach might be involved in speaking with the club management, selecting players, organising training, arranging travel to matches and responding to any number of ad-hoc requests or situations. Having good systems in place means that issues can be dealt with before they become problems, and enables tasks to be shared across a coaching group effectively.

Examples of systems:

- Central shared database of players and contact information
  - _I use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)_
- Central list of adminstration tasks shared across coaching / management group
  - _I use [Trello](https://trello.com/) a free app that allows several people to collaborate on tasks without having to have meetings_
- Templated e-mails and standard patterns of communication
  - _I use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)_
- A selection process that allows all squads to select from the available player pool
  - _I use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) for this but plan to move to a better system soon_
- Shared training resources and playbooks
  - _Again I use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)_

All of these tools have something in common: they are shared. The more processes are standardised the easier it is to share tasks across a group and still keep track of progress. By creating systems and sticking to them there is no need to think anew each time and it is easy to delegate.

Having a good system to keep track of tasks, document decisions

First and foremost being on top of administration means that you are less likely to have a last minute surprise that de-rails plans. Whilst all plans need adaptation the better thought through your objectives as a coach, be it in a game or a training session, the easier it is for your to adapt your plan on the hoof.

With one or two sessions a week every minute on the grass is valuable.

## Creating clarity for players

Players look to coaches for answers. The more of these answers that we coaches have the more we build confidence in the playing group that we are doing our jobs correctly.
Several benefits:

- Inspires confidence that coaching plans are well thought through
- Enablers players to focus on playing
- Goes some way to ensuring consistent messages are provided to players

 We also free players up to express themselves, they don't need to worry about organisational details, they can focus on playing and enjoying their rugby.

## Bringing ideas to life

Ideas left to fester without actions can rot away, it is too easy for doubt to creep in and the moment is gone.

Sometimes asking for forgiveness rather than permission...

Ideas left to fester can rot away, it is easy to start to find reasons not to do something
On the contrary ideas discussed and developed turn into tangible actions, experiments, trials which in turn feed on themselves

By experimenting, or asking the questions the hypothetical becomes the real.

That is not to say that all ideas are good
