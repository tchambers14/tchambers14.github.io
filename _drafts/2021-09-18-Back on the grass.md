It has been great over the past few months getting back on the grass at the rugby club and preparing a squad for a demanding league season ahead. This weekend sees a rest weekend after a bruising first 8 weeks of the London South East 2 season. Having not played rugby for 17 months players and coaches alike were desperate to get into competitive league fixtures again. 

Injuries.

Coaching community



the OA's first league game for 17 months, and hopefully the end of the COVID-19 disruption. Whilst I enjoy all aspects of the game training lacks the emotional rollercoaster that comes from competitive games, The physicality of the contact, the tension of a defensive set, the frustration and the highs of scoring. The key thing training lacks is the stories about the game told in the aftermath.  rugby including training and touch, there is a keen sense of anticipation that comes with the jeopardy of league competition.

As a coach it is the first time new ideas will be properly tested, for the players it will be the first real test, a meaningful game.


The key missing ingredient is the highs and lows that come from a competitive game. 
So many of the aspects of the game that are not covered in touch games start to take on significance. Catch and drive, lineout, transition, kick return. 

This feeds into training for the next week, the next game and the rhythm of the league season starts.

It will be interesting times, I can't wait.

Rugby for me is all about enjoyment, seeing things click on the pitch, players supporting and coaching each other to improve and a sense that momentum is building is a great feeling.
